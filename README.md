---

## Description :house:

AirBnB clone is a complete web application, integrating database storage, 
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

## Classes :cl:


|     | BaseModel | FileStorage | User | State | City | Amenity | Place | Review |
| --- | --------- | ----------- | -----| ----- | -----| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| **PUBLIC INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES** | `id`<br>`created_at`<br>`updated_at` | | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` |
| **PUBLIC INSTANCE METHODS** | `save`<br>`to_dict` | `all`<br>`new`<br>`save`<br>`reload` | "" | "" | "" | "" | "" | "" |
| **PUBLIC CLASS ATTRIBUTES** | | | `email`<br>`password`<br>`first_name`<br>`last_name`| `name` | `state_id`<br>`name` | `name` | `city_id`<br>`user_id`<br>`name`<br>`description`<br>`number_rooms`<br>`number_bathrooms`<br>`max_guest`<br>`price_by_night`<br>`latitude`<br>`longitude`<br>`amenity_ids` | `place_id`<br>`user_id`<br>`text` | 
| **PRIVATE CLASS ATTRIBUTES** | | `file_path`<br>`objects` | | | | | | |

## Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the 
[FileStorage](./models/engine/file_storage.py) class.

Every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB instantiates an instance of 
`FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object is loaded/re-loaded from 
any class instances stored in the JSON file `file.json`. As class instances are 
created, updated, or deleted, the `storage` object is used to register 
corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend 
of AirBnB clone. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by 
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

The AirBnB clone console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. 
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution 
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

Alternatively, to use the console in interactive mode, run:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: `$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash`


## Testing :straight_ruler:

Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the [tests](./tests) 
folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
